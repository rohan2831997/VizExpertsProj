Thank you for the opportunity to present my work to you.

1. Input coordinates can be put in the input file(input,txt)

Range of x -> (0,800)
Range of y -> (0,400)

2. To change the width of the extruded part, in the main function go to line number 114, the second value in the constructor of curvemaker is the extruded width.
